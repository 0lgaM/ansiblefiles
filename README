Installation tasks still have some issues:

0. When you install smth for the first time on AWS instance, you need to add role "start" for automatical 'apt update' and 'apt upgrade'.

1. On the mysql database creation step (~/roles/mysql/tasks/main.yml) ansible needs to use db password. Default mysql installation includes root/nopassword credentials, so you need to change password manually. I added ansible module 'pause' with description of MYSQL query you need to do.

2. In zabbix installation tasks (~/roles/zabbix/tasks/main.yml) you need to unzip .gz archive (because importing .sql.gz file in db didn't work). Ansible module 'unarchive' can't work with this format so it's performing with gunzip command. For the first time you need to uncomment this task and to comment it next time.
